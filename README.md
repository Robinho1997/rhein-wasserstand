# rhein-wasserstand

This repo displays the src code of this website which shows the current water depth of the rhein river at the locations in my area. I used a rest APi to fetch the Data from "pegelonline".
To display the current weather I fetched the weather data from openweathermap.

Why did I made this website?
Well before I go fishing I usually check the current water depth and weather of the various locations. But it always annoys me to open multiple tabs to check for the data.
With this Website I only need to open one and get a good visualization of the data in one view.
